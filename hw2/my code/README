My submission is a tcp client/server. The server recieves data from ther server
line by line and prints each line backwards.

tcpserver.c
  This creates a socket to listen for a connection and reverse each line from the
  connection once it receives data.

tcpclient.c
  This creates a socket to connect to the server (given to correct address and port)
  and sends a file to the server line by line.


The server closes immediately after a client finishes sending, which is what we were told
to do, but it doesn't make since especially if were listening for more than one
connection. Also, when testing if i ended the server before running the client succesfully,
the port would be occupied for a little while after. Another issue is that, even though
the client will not connect if the port or address are incorrect, it doesn't tell you
which one is the issue. I'm not really sure how to do that or if it's even possible since
you haven't actually connected to the server to get the actual port and address. Also,
sometimes when you give the client the wrong address it just waits forever and does nothing
instead of not connecting.

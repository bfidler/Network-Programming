This submission is a multithreaded client/server program where the server creates
a file based off the file from the client. The server reverses each lines sent by
the client

Server - Creates a file with the timestamp for each client and writes each line
	reversed. It uses threads rather than forks

Client - Connects to the server based off IP and Port number and opens a file to
	send to the server

Makefile - Compiles the client and server and can remove executables and .o files
	as well.

There are many files, so I'm not going to list them all but basically there's the
files for NameServer, the files for FileServer, and the client file.

Everything works just fine except when I call client create on the host for the file
server, it doesn't connect. I used the same host as the name server but it doesn't
work for the file server for whatever reason. Everything else seems to be working
though and I think I have the structure correct.

RPC Client/Server Program<BR>
Due Date: April 29th (by 11:59PM) </H2><HR>
<H3>Project Description</H3>
<P>This project is to write RPC client and server programs in <b>C or C++.&nbsp; 
</b>Your programs should have the following functions: </P>
<P class=indent><b>RPC Name Server</b></P>
<P class=indent>Your name server will maintain a configuration file that store 
information, like name, hostname, about other RPC servers. The name server will 
have two functions. One is for other RPC servers to register with Name Server. The 
other is for RPC clients to get hostname about RPC servers by 
their name. When there is a RPC server register with Name server, it will update 
the configuration file.  
When there is a request from client, it will read the information from 
configuration file. Here are functions/procedures needed to implemented by Name server.</P>
<P class=indent>int registerServer(char [] name, char[] hostname);</P>
<P class=indent>int removeServer(char[] name);</P>
<P class=indent>string getServerHostName(char [] name);</P>
<div class="page">
	<p class="indent">Below is an example of a command line that could be used 
	to run your RPC Name server:</p>
	<p class="indent">./NameServer</div>
<P class=indent><b>RPC File Server</b></P>
<P class=indent>Your RPC File Server will be a server for client to retrieve 
files and a client of RPC Name Server. When your RPC File Server starts, it will 
first run as a RPC client to register its hostname to RPC name server. You can 
implement the File server in two processes. Your parent process will be the RPC 
client to the Name server. After registering with Name server, you will use 
fork() to create a child process to execute the RPC file server function. The 
file sever will be an iterative server and it will handle one client a time. The 
File server will only have one function to let client get a file by its name:</P>
<P class=indent>string getFile ( char [] name);</P>
<p class="indent">Below is an example of a command line that could be used to 
run RPC File server:</p>
<p class="indent">./FileServer spider2.cs.clemson.edu</p>
<p class="indent">The first command line parameter (argv[1]) must be the 
	host name of RPC Name server. </p>
<H3><b><font size="3">RPC Client</font></b></H3>
<p>Your RPC Client will be both client to RPC name server and RPC file server. 
The RPC Client will first be a client of RPC Name server and call a remote 
procedure to get the hostname about the RPC file server. Then, the RPC client 
will be a client of RPC file server to retrieve a file. The file name will pass 
through arguments of RPC Client. </p>
<div class="page">
	<p class="indent">Below is an example of a command line that could be used 
	to run your RPC client and require a file specified by &quot;myfile&quot;:</p>
	<p class="indent">./client&nbsp; spider2.cs.clemson.edu&nbsp;&nbsp;FileServer myfile</p>
	<p class="indent">The first command line parameter (argv[1]) must be the 
	host name of RPC Name server. <br>The second parameter (argv[2]) is the name of the the file server.<br>
	The third parameter (argv[3]) is the name of the ASCII file to be retrieve 
	from the file server.
<H3>Deliverables</H3>
<P>You must submit all the source code necessary for us to build and test your 
RPC client and server. These files must include two server programs and one 
client program. You must also include Makefile that can be used to build your 
client and server on the CS Linux workstations. </P>
<P>You must also include in your submission a file named <CODE>README</CODE> 
that includes your name and a brief description of your submission, including 
the name of each file submitted along with a one line description of what is in 
the file. If your code is not complete, tell us what works and what doesn't. If 
you are submitting code that does not compile, please tell us that as well. If 
any of your code was written by someone else, you are required to tell us about 
it (this must also be documented in the code itself). Finally, feel free to 
include a description of any problems you had or anything else you think might 
be helpful to us. </P>
<H3>Grading</H3>
<P>Your project will be tested to make sure it works properly. Here is a rough breakdown of the grading:</P>
<TABLE cellSpacing=10 border=0>
	<TBODY>
		<TR>
			<TD>RPC Name Server</TD>
			<TD>20%</TD>
		<TR>
			<TD>RPC File Server</TD>
			<TD>30%</TD>
		<TR>
			<TD>RPC Client</TD>
			<TD>30%</TD>
		<TR>
			<TD>Error handling, Style/Code structure, etc.</TD>
			<TD>20%</TD>
	</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<P>NOTE: 20% of your homework grade depends on the how "well your code is 
written". These points include the following:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Error handling (check every system call for an error!).</LI>
	<LI>Safe code (avoiding buffer overflow, etc).</LI>
	<LI>
	<P>How well we can understand your code. There is no required format for your 
  code, there is <B>no</B> requirement like "you must have one comment for every 
  5 lines of code". Feel free to provide whatever level of commenting you 
  believe is appropriate to make sure that other competent programmers could 
  easily understand and make changes to your code.</P></LI>
</UL>
<H3>Submitting your files</H3>
	<font face="Arial">All projects must be submitted via handin: </font>
	<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
	<a href="https://handin.cs.clemson.edu">https://handin.cs.clemson.edu</a></span><P><font face="Arial">Please make sure you submit all your source files not the object files.&nbsp; 
You can also zip the files using the following command first:</font>
	<P>&nbsp;
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; tar&nbsp;&nbsp; 
cvzf&nbsp;&nbsp; hw5.tgz&nbsp;&nbsp; file1&nbsp; file2&nbsp;&nbsp; file3&nbsp; 
...</font><P><font face="Arial">and submit the 
single zip file hw6.tgz.&nbsp; Before you submit this single file, please use 
the following command to check make sure you have everything in this zip file:</font>
<P>
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&gt; tar&nbsp;&nbsp; tvzf&nbsp;&nbsp; hw5.tgz</font><P><B>Don't send compiled code! Please ask question if you don't understand any 
part of this project.</B></P>
